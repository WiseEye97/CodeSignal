    A group of farmers has some elevation data that we are going to use to help them understand how rainfall flows over their farmland. 
    We represent the farmland as a 2D array of altitudes, the grid, and use the following model, based on the fact that water flows downhill:

        - If a cell's four neighboring cells all have altitudes not lower that its own, this cell is a sink in which water collects.
        - Otherwise, water will flow into the neighboring cell with the lowest altitude. If a cell is not a sink, you can assume it has a unique lowest neighbor and that this neighbor will be lower than the cell.
        - Cells that drain into the same sink, directly or indirectly, are part of the same basin.

    Given an n Ã— n grid of elevations, your goal is to partition the map into basins and output the sizes of the basins, in descending order.
